excerpt: 'This paper was created in the context of my bachelor thesis. The goal was to develop a self-learning optimization algorithm that can adapt to the problem at hand. The algorithm was tested on a set of benchmark functions and compared to other optimization algorithms. The results show that the algorithm is able to adapt to the problem at hand and outperforms other algorithms in some cases.'

This paper was created in the context of my bachelor thesis. The goal was to develop a self-learning optimization algorithm that can adapt to the problem at hand. The algorithm was tested on a set of benchmark functions and compared to other optimization algorithms. The results show that the algorithm is able to adapt to the problem at hand and outperforms other algorithms in some cases.
